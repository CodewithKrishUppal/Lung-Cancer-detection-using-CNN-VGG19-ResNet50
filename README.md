# Lung-Cancer-detection-using-CNN-VGG19-ResNet50
In this study, three deep learning models—ResNet, CNN, and VGG19—were compared for their
performance in lung cancer classification. The models were evaluated based on their validation
accuracy, with ResNet yielding the highest performance, followed by CNN and VGG19.
● ResNet achieved the best training accuracy of 99%, demonstrating its superior ability to
capture complex patterns and features in the dataset. ResNet's deep architecture and
residual connections allowed it to perform exceptionally well, avoiding issues such as
vanishing gradients, which can affect deeper models.
● CNN followed with a training accuracy of 97%, showing strong performance with its
simpler architecture compared to ResNet. While CNNs can still effectively capture
spatial hierarchies in images, they may struggle with the complexities that deeper
architectures like ResNet can handle.
● VGG19 achieved a training accuracy of 96%, slightly behind CNN and ResNet. Despite
its relatively deep architecture with 19 layers, the absence of advanced features like
residual connections limits its ability to handle complex datasets as effectively as ResNet.
These results indicate that while all three models can effectively classify lung cancer images,
ResNet outperforms the other architectures in this specific task, likely due to its ability to learn
more complex features. However, the performance of CNN and VGG19 remains strong,
suggesting that they can also be effective choices depending on the specific requirements and
computational constraints of the project.
